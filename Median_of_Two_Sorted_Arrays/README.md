There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

My note: this is quite a nasty problem. The binary search itself is clean and clear <br>
just the edge condition check, what if one array or both arrays are empty. edge cases also include use all values from nums1 or zero from nums1, etc.
