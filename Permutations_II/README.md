Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.

For example,
[1,1,2] have the following unique permutations:
[1,1,2], [1,2,1], and [2,1,1].

my note: an easy way to remove duplicate is to 'sort' duplicate so that there is only one option to form a sequence
